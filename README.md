# a2b2 arg easymode bot
So they took too long solving the game, as such this bot is going to be a vehicle to drop some info and content at the players.

## Running
This bot looks for a BOT_TOKEN env variable that can be loaded from a .env file in the root directory of the repo or using environment variables directly. It can also take a guild ID for scoping slash command registration to one guild, but this is optional.

.env file sample:
BOT_TOKEN: yourtokenhere
GUILD_ID: yourguildidhere_onlyifyoureallywantthough
